  "l1": {
    "title": "Blockchain Basics",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is a blockchain?",
      "hint": "Imagine a public notebook. Many pages (blocks) are linked.",
      "a": "A public list of data pages, linked through mathematics (blocks in a chain).",
      "b": "A video game with coins and levels.",
      "c": "The company's secret database.",
      "d": "An app that runs only on your phone.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. The chain makes old pages difficult to alter.",
      "b.fb": "Not quite. It is a shared database, not a game.",
      "c.fb": "No. Many can examine it; it is not secret.",
      "d.fb": "No. It runs on many computers (Nodes), not just yours."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Who can see Stellar transactions?",
      "hint": "Public network ≠ public names.",
      "a": "Everyone can see them, but not your real name (nur Public Keys).",
      "b": "Only the sender can see them.",
      "c": "Only banks can see them.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. The data is public, but identities are not included.",
      "b.fb": "No. The ledger is public for transparency.",
      "c.fb": "No. Anyone can look up transactions."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Warum sind Blöcke miteinander ‚verkettet‘?",
      "hint": "Old pages should be difficult to change.",
      "a": "So that changing old data becomes very difficult.",
      "b": "To make the app look cooler.",
      "c": "So that everything works offline forever.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. Each block secures the previous one through mathematics (Hashes).",
      "b.fb": "No. It's about safety, not style.",
      "c.fb": "No. Nodes still need to synchronize."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is it possible to simply delete an error in a transaction?",
      "hint": "Remember: append only, do not delete.",
      "a": "No. One makes a new, correcting transaction.",
      "b": "Yes, you just remove them from the chain.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. The ledger is append-only. We make corrections with new entries.",
      "b.fb": "No. Past entries are not deleted."
    }
  },
  "l4": {
    "title": "Keys, fees, and trustlines",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is a public key?",
      "hint": "Like your mailing address.",
      "a": "An address for receiving. You may share it.",
      "b": "A secret password to control your account.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. You may share your public key.",
      "b.fb": "That describes the Secret Key, not the Public Key."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "You should never share your secret key.",
      "hint": "He is the key to your money.",
      "true": "True",
      "false": "Incorrect",
      "true.fb": "Correct. Secret Key = Control. Never enter it on unknown sites.",
      "false.fb": "Incorrect. Keep it private. Use the testnet only for learning."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Why does Stellar charge tiny fees?",
      "hint": "Think about spam protection.",
      "a": "To stop spam and keep the network healthy.",
      "b": "So that a company becomes wealthy.",
      "c": "Because transactions are always slow.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. Small fees prevent spam and reward validators.",
      "b.fb": "No. The fees are minimal and serve security purposes.",
      "c.fb": "No. Stellar is fast and cheap."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What is a trustline?",
      "hint": "It's like a permission.",
      "a": "A permission to hold a token from an issuer.",
      "b": "A secret chat line between two accounts.",
      "c": "A special fee discount on trading.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. You choose which issuers/tokens you trust.",
      "b.fb": "No. It is not a chat, but a holding permit.",
      "c.fb": "No. Trustlines involve the holding of assets."
    }
  },
  "l7": {
    "title": "Security, Phishing, and Trust",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Eine Website will deinen Secret Key, um dein Guthaben zu ‚prüfen‘. Was tust du?",
      "hint": "Never share your secret key.",
      "a": "Leave the page. Never enter the Secret Key.",
      "b": "Enter, but only once.",
      "c": "Instead, share a screenshot of your key.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. This is phishing. Only use trusted wallets.",
      "b.fb": "No. Just once is enough to lose control.",
      "c.fb": "I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "You see two tokens named USDX. How do you find the real one?",
      "hint": "Names can be copied. Issuers and domains matter.",
      "a": "Check issuer account and verify domain/asset information.",
      "b": "Go with the one with the nicer logo.",
      "c": "Coin toss. They are equal.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. Asset code is not enough. Verify the issuer and domain.",
      "b.fb": "Logos can be forged. Verify the issuer/domain.",
      "c.fb": "No. They can be very different. Always check."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "In einfachen Worten ist ‚Verifizierung/KYC‘ (Know Your Customer) ein Prozess, bei dem Unternehmen bestätigen, wer ihre Kunden sind. Dies geschieht oft durch das Überprüfen von Ausweisdokumenten und anderen Informationen, um sicherzustellen, dass die Kunden wirklich die sind, die sie vorgeben zu sein.",
      "hint": "Some services need to know who you are.",
      "a": "A process in which a service verifies your identity.",
      "b": "A method to accelerate blockchain.",
      "c": "Share his secret key with a bank.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. This helps prevent fraud and complies with laws.",
      "b.fb": "No. It's about identity, not speed.",
      "c.fb": "No. Never share your secret key. KYC does not need it."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Was ist ein ‚Zero-Knowledge Proof‘ (ZK) in einfachen Worten?",
      "hint": "Prove that you know something without revealing the secret.",
      "a": "A proof that something is true without revealing the secret.",
      "b": "A tool that hides all transactions forever.",
      "c": "A faster way to send payments.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. Example: Prove that you are over 13 without stating your birthdate.",
      "b.fb": "No. ZK proves facts but does not delete entries.",
      "c.fb": "No, it's about data-efficient proofs."
