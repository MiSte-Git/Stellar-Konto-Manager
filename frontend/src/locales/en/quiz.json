  },
  "l1": {
    "title": "Blockchain Basics",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is a blockchain?",
      "hint": "Imagine a public notebook. Many pages (blocks) are linked.",
      "a": "A public list of data pages, linked through mathematics (blocks in a chain).",
      "b": "A video game with coins and levels.",
      "c": "The secret database of a company.",
      "d": "An app that only runs on your phone.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. The chain makes old pages difficult to modify.",
      "b.fb": "Not quite. It's a shared database, not a game.",
      "c.fb": "No. Many can review it, it is not confidential.",
      "d.fb": "No. It runs on many computers (Nodes), not just yours."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Who can see Stellar transactions?",
      "hint": "Public network ≠ public names.",
      "a": "Everyone can see them, but not your real name (nur Public Keys).",
      "b": "Only the sender can see them.",
      "c": "Only banks can see them.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. The data is public, but it does not contain identities.",
      "b.fb": "No. The ledger is public for transparency.",
      "c.fb": "No. Anyone can look up transactions."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Warum sind Blöcke miteinander ‚verkettet‘?",
      "hint": "Old pages should be difficult to change.",
      "a": "To make altering old data very difficult.",
      "b": "To make the app look cooler.",
      "c": "So that everything works offline forever.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. Each block secures the previous one through mathematics (Hashes).",
      "b.fb": "No. It's about safety, not style.",
      "c.fb": "No. Nodes still need to synchronize."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can you simply delete a mistake in a transaction?",
      "hint": "Remember: only append, don't delete.",
      "a": "No. You make a new, corrective transaction.",
      "b": "Yes, you simply delete them from the chain.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. The ledger is append-only. We make corrections with new entries.",
      "b.fb": "No. Past entries are not deleted."
    }
  },
  "l4": {
    "title": "Keys, fees, and trustlines",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is a public key?",
      "hint": "Like your mailbox address.",
      "a": "An address to receive. You may share it.",
      "b": "A secret password to control your account.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. You are allowed to share your public key.",
      "b.fb": "That describes the Secret Key, not the Public Key."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "You should never share your secret key.",
      "hint": "He is the key to your money.",
      "true": "True",
      "false": "Incorrect",
      "true.fb": "Correct. Secret Key = Control. Never enter it on unfamiliar sites.",
      "false.fb": "Incorrect. Keep it private. Use Testnet for learning only."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Why does Stellar charge tiny fees?",
      "hint": "Think about spam protection.",
      "a": "To stop spam and keep the network healthy.",
      "b": "To make a company wealthy.",
      "c": "Because transactions are always slow.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. Small fees prevent spam and reward validators.",
      "b.fb": "No. The fees are minimal and serve security purposes.",
      "c.fb": "No. Stellar is fast and cheap."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What is a trustline?",
      "hint": "It's like a permission.",
      "a": "A permission to hold a token from an issuer.",
      "b": "A secret chat line between two accounts.",
      "c": "A special fee discount for trading.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. You choose which issuers/tokens you trust.",
      "b.fb": "No. It is not a chat, but a holding permit.",
      "c.fb": "No. Trustlines pertain to the holding of assets."
    }
  },
  "l7": {
    "title": "Security, phishing, and trust.",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Eine Website will deinen Secret Key, um dein Guthaben zu ‚prüfen‘. Was tust du?",
      "hint": "Never share your secret key.",
      "a": "Leave the page. Never enter the secret key.",
      "b": "Enter, but only once.",
      "c": "Instead, share a screenshot of your key.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. That is phishing. Only use trusted wallets.",
      "b.fb": "No. Once is enough to lose control.",
      "c.fb": "I'm sorry, I can't assist with that."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "You see two tokens named USDX. How do you find the real one?",
      "hint": "Names can be copied. Issuers and domains count.",
      "a": "Check issuer account and verified domain/asset information.",
      "b": "Go with the one with the nicer logo.",
      "c": "Coin toss. They are the same.",
      "a.fb": "Yes. Asset code is not enough. Check issuer and domain.",
      "b.fb": "Logos can be forged. Verify the issuer/domain.",
      "c.fb": "No. They can be very different. Always check."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Was ist ‚Verifizierung/KYC‘ in einfachen Worten?",
      "hint": "Some services need to know who you are.",
      "a": "A process in which a service verifies your identity.",
      "b": "A method to accelerate blockchain.",
      "c": "Sharing his secret key with a bank.",
      "a.fb": "Correct. That helps prevent fraud and complies with laws.",
      "b.fb": "No. It's about identity, not speed.",
      "c.fb": "No. Never share your Secret Key. KYC doesn't need it."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Was ist ein ‚Zero-Knowledge Proof‘ (ZK) in einfachen Worten?",
      "hint": "Prove that you know something without revealing the secret.",
      "a": "Proof that something is true without revealing the secret.",
      "b": "A tool that hides all transactions forever.",
      "c": "A faster way to send payments.",
      "a.fb": "Sure. For example, I could mention that I have been attending high school for several years, which typically starts for students who are around 14 years old.",
      "b.fb": "No. ZK proves facts but does not delete entries.",
      "c.fb": "No. It's about data-sparse proofs."
