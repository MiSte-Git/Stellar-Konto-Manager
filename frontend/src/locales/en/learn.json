    "title": "A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. Each block in the chain contains multiple transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger. This ensures transparency and security, as the data is distributed and verified across multiple nodes, making it difficult for any single entity to manipulate the information.",
