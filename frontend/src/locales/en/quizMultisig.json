    "question": "Why use multisig?",
    "hint": "Think of shared responsibility.",
    "a1": "To reduce the risk of individual key losses.",
    "a1fb": "Correct: Multiple signatures reduce individual risk.",
    "a2": "To save on fees.",
    "a2fb": "Incorrect: Multisig enhances security, not fees.",
    "a3": "To send more quickly.",
    "a3fb": "Wrong: Multisig is not designed for speed."
  },
  "q2": {
    "question": "When is a transaction on a multisig account valid?",
    "hint": "Look at the weighted signatures.",
    "a1": "If the signatures reach the required threshold.",
    "a1fb": "Correct: The sum of the weights must meet the threshold.",
    "a2": "As soon as any signature is present.",
    "a2fb": "Wrong: A single signature is not sufficient if the threshold is higher.",
    "a3": "Only with master key, regardless of the threshold.",
    "a3fb": "Incorrect: The master key is also subject to thresholds."
  },
  "q3": {
    "question": "What happens if thresholds are set incorrectly?",
    "hint": "Values that are too high or too low have consequences.",
    "a1": "Transactions could be blocked or too easily approved.",
    "a1fb": "Correct: Incorrect thresholds lead to lockouts or insufficient security.",
    "a2": "Nothing at all, thresholds are just information.",
    "a2fb": "Incorrect: Thresholds control how many signatures are required.",
    "a3": "The account sequence number is being reset.",
    "a3fb": "Incorrect: Thresholds have no impact on the sequence."
  },
  "q4": {
    "question": "How many signatures are required for a transaction with Threshold med?",
    "hint": "Med threshold = median threshold.",
    "a1": "Weights of the signatures must at least reach the med-threshold.",
    "a1fb": "Correct: The median threshold applies to payments.",
    "a2": "Only ever one signature.",
    "a2fb": "Incorrect: It depends on weights and thresholds.",
    "a3": "Always all signers.",
    "a3fb": "Incorrect: Only enough signatures to meet the threshold."
  },
  "q5": {
    "question": "How should secret keys be stored in real multisig setups?",
    "hint": "Separation is security.",
    "a1": "Separated on different devices/locations.",
    "a1fb": "Correct: Signatures should be collected separately.",
    "a2": "All on the same laptop for convenience.",
    "a2fb": "Incorrect: A device poses a single point of failure.",
    "a3": "Share plainly in a chat.",
    "a3fb": "Incorrect: Never share secret keys."
