    "introDialog1": "Hi! I'm Lumio and I just landed on the Stellar blockchain! 🌟",
    "introDialog2": "But I don't have an account here yet... can you help me create one?",
    "keypairTitle": "Step 1 – What is a Keypair?",
    "keypairNarrator": "Every account on Stellar consists of two keys: the [[Public Key|publicKey]] (your address) and the [[Secret Key|privateKey]] (your password). Only someone who knows the Secret Key can send money.",
    "choicePublicKeyLabel": "I share the Public Key with others so they can send me XLM.",
    "choicePublicKeyHint": "Exactly! The [[Public Key|publicKey]] is like a bank account number – you can share it publicly. ✓",
    "choiceSecretShareLabel": "I give my Secret Key to someone I trust.",
    "choiceSecretShareHint": "Careful! NOBODY should know the [[Secret Key|privateKey]] – not even Stellar or Lumio. It gives full access to your account.",
    "choiceSameLabel": "Both keys are actually the same thing.",
    "choiceSameHint": "That's not correct. The Public and Secret Key form a pair, but have completely different roles.",

    "warningDialog1": "Wow, we now have a keypair! Note down the Secret Key somewhere – but never show it to anyone!",
    "warningDialog2": "On the real network I'd recommend writing it on paper and keeping it somewhere safe.",
    "activateTitle": "Step 3 – Activate the Account",
    "activateNarrator": "A new Stellar account must first be activated – it needs at least 1 XLM as a reserve. On the Testnet, the '[[Friendbot|friendbot]]' gives us free test XLM.",
    "friendbotLabel": "Request Friendbot",
    "friendbotDesc": "Sends a request to the Stellar Friendbot, which activates our test account with 10,000 test XLM.",
    "friendbotError": "No keypair found – please generate one first.",
    "outroDialog1": "We have a real account on the Stellar Testnet! I can already see the XLM in the blockchain...",
    "outroDialog2": "You learned that quickly! In the next chapter we'll send XLM together.",

    "summaryLearning1": "Every Stellar account consists of a Public Key (address) and Secret Key (password)",
    "summaryLearning2": "The Secret Key must never be shared",

    "lumio_1a": "I want to send 10 XLM to my friend Cosmo! But how does that work?",
    "lumio_1b": "I hear there's something called a transaction... what exactly is that?",
    "narrator_tx": "A [[transaction|transaction]] on Stellar is an instruction to the network: send X XLM from account A to account B. The network checks the balance, deducts a small [[base fee|base_fee]], and writes everything to the [[ledger|ledger]].",
    "choice1_a": "It pays the network nodes and prevents spam transactions.",
    "choice1_b": "It goes directly to the Stellar Development Foundation as profit.",
    "choice1_c": "It's optional – you can leave it out.",
    "choice1_a_hint": "Exactly! The [[base fee|base_fee]] is very small (0.00001 XLM) but important for network security.",
    "choice1_b_hint": "Wrong – the fees are burned, not collected.",
    "choice1_c_hint": "Wrong – without a fee the transaction will be rejected.",
    "lumio_2": "And what is this Memo field I see in some wallets?",
    "narrator_memo": "The [[Memo|memo]] field is an optional comment on the transaction – maximum 28 characters. Exchanges use it to identify the sender. Without the correct Memo your funds can be lost!",
    "choice2_a": "Always – without a Memo the transaction will be rejected.",
    "choice2_b": "When sending to an exchange that requires a Memo.",
    "choice2_c": "Never – the Memo field is outdated and no longer used.",
    "choice2_a_hint": "Not always – between regular wallets the Memo is optional.",

    "lumio_4a": "I see it! The transaction is on the blockchain! The [[transaction hash|transaction_hash]] is like a receipt number – anyone can look up the transaction with it.",
    "lumio_4b": "In the Stellar Explorer you can publicly view any transaction using the hash.",
